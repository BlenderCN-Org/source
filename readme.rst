********************************
This Week in Blender Development
********************************

This purpose of this repository is to try out keeping a log of weekly development activity, similar to:
`This Week in Rust <https://this-week-in-rust.org/>`__
with a focus on development - since there are already news sites for more general topics.


Working
=======

- ``rev``, ``task``, ``diff`` roles *(only for Sphinx builds, not online preview)*.
- RSS feed via the ``newsfeed`` extension *(patched to include all weeks without explicitly listing).*


Open Topics
===========

- Where to host the HTML, RSS feed?
- Policy for who contributes?
  *(suggest all Blender devs get automatic access, otherwise handle on case by case basis).*
- Should this use a mailing list?
- What theme to use? (see `Awesome Sphinx Themes <https://github.com/yoloseem/awesome-sphinxdoc#themes>`__)


To Do
=====

Test week.
